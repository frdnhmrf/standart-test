Challenge Description:

Wowo walks through 100 switches from point A to point B with the numbers 1 to 100. On the first trip, Wowo presses all of the switches so the lamps are on. On the second trip, Wowo only presses switches that are multiples of two. On the next trip, Wowo presses switches that are multiples of three. Wowo repeats his trips from A to B for 100 times. Write down the code to determine how many lamps will turn on after 100 trips from A to B.
